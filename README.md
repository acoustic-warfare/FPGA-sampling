# Welcome to the Acoustic Warfare FPGA Sampling GitHub

Information about the project and a user guide on how to build and run the project can be found under the [Project Wiki](../../wiki).

A more comprehensive description of all the different components of the project by the end of summer 2023 can be found in the [Project Report](https://github.com/acoustic-warfare/Beamforming/blob/main/Ljudkriget.pdf). 

A shortcut to the [User Manual](https://github.com/acoustic-warfare/FPGA-sampling/wiki/User-Manual) can be found here.

The following block diagram showcases an overview of the flow from the microphone array to a receiving PC:
