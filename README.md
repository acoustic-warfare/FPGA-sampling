# Welcome to the Acoustic Warfare FPGA Sampling GitHub

Information about the project and a user guide on how to build and run the project can be found under the [Project Wiki](../../wiki).

A more comprehensive description of all the different components of the project can be found in the [Project Report](https://github.com/acoustic-warfare/Beamforming/blob/main/Ljudkriget.pdf). 

A shortcut to the [User Manual](https://github.com/acoustic-warfare/FPGA-sampling/wiki/User-Manual) can be found here.

To learn how to test the arrays, refer to the [Test Manual](/doc/testing_manual/Testing_the_arrays_version_1.pdf). Download the Test Manual to see the included links on page 2.

All tests and results were done on PCBA-1 version one (the version without buffers).

The following block diagram showcases an overview of the flow from the microphone array to a receiving PC:
